Serialization?

It is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be easily stored, transmitted, or reconstructed at a later time. This format is typically a sequence of bytes or a string that preserves the original object's state.


Deserialization?

It is the process of reconstructing an object or data structure from its serialized form. 
During deserialization, the serialized data is parsed and interpreted according to the format in which it was serialized. The process involves reading the serialized data and creating a new object or data structure that represents the original data's state.
